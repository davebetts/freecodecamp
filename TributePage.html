  Designation of Pluto as a Dwarf Planet
  </h3>
<p>Since it's discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto was known as the 9th planet in the solar system.  As more information was discovered about Pluto, this small solar satellite appeared to have less and less in common with the other planets.  During this same time additional objects orbiting the Sun were also being discovered.  These new objects appeared to have more in common with Pluto than Pluto did with the 8 other planets.  
  The dwarf planets are large enough to be spheroid in shape, but not large enough to have cleared out the objects within their orbit.
  In 2006 the decision was made to classify Pluto and a few other objects as as dwarf planets.</p>

<h5>
  Current List of Dwarf Planets
  </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Pluto</li>
    <li>Ceres</li>
    <li>Eris</li>
    <li>Haumea</li>
    <li>Makemake</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h5>
  Negative Reaction from the Public
  </h5>
<p> Even though Pluto's assignment was changed from the 9th planet to the FIRST object designated as a dwarf planet, the public reaction has included a fair share of criticism.  For some, the change in classification has been viewed as a "demotion" for Pluto.</p>
<h3>
  Why the desigination of Dwarf Planet is good
  </h3>
<p>
  There are at least two reasons why the designation of dwarf planet is good.
  <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: bold">The designation of "dwarf planet" makes it easier to to discuss objects in the solar system</li>
    <p>
      Previous discussions of of the planets required multiple exceptions in order to include Pluto.  The change in category will assist scientific discussions of both planets and dwarf planets.  The new categorization may also lend to future advances in scientific research.
    </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold">The Solar System is more than just the Sun and the planets</li>
  <p>Because Pluto is so well known, the categorization as a dwarf planet is a perfect reason to discuss the variety of other objects in the Solar System.  Because of the change in designation, my kids learned about a wide variety of objects in the Solar System even in though they were in their very first years of elementary school.  Because of Pluto, in addition to the Sun and the eight planets, at a very early age my kids have learned about:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Asteroids</li>
      <li>The Asteroid Belt</li>
      <li>Comets</li>
      <li>The Kuiper Belt</li>
      <li>The Oort Cloud</li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
