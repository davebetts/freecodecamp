  Designation of Pluto as a Dwarf Planet
  </h3>
Since it's discovery in 1930 until 2006, pluto was known as the 9th planet in the solar system.  As more information was discovered about Pluto, this small solar satellite appeared to have less and less in common with the other plants.  During this time additional objects orbiting the Sun were being discovered.  These new objects appeared to have more in common with Pluto than the 8 other planets.  They are large enough to be spheroid in shape, but not large enough to have cleared out the objects within their orbit.
  In 2006 the decision was made to classify Pluto and a few other objects as as dwarf planets.

  <h3>
  Negative Reaction from the Public
  </h3>
<p> Even though Pluto's assignment was changed from the 9th planet to the first object designated as a dwarf planet, the public reaction has had a fair share of criticism.  The change in classification has been viewed as a "demotion" for Pluto by some.</p>
<h3>
  Why the desigination of Dwarf Planet is good
  </h3>
<p>
  There are at least two reasons why the designation of dwarf planet is good.
  <ol>
    <li>The designation of "dwarf planet" makes it easier to to discuss objects in the solar system</li>
    When discussing Pluto, instead of trying

<h3>The Solar System is more than just the Sun and the planets</h3>
Because Pluto is so well known, the classification as a dwarf planet is a great way to emphasize all of the things that exist in the Solar System.

  <li>8 planets</li>
  <li>The asteroid belt and other asteroids</li>
